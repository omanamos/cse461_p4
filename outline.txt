TODO: every time you hear a GDAY, spoof the GBYE
      set it up so that attack doesn't break ours
      spoof as them
      
TODO: should the receiver display messages from 
      hosts not currently in the group

Object takes a multicast address and nickname for its ctor param
- We need a hashtable from nickname -> source IP, port, timestamp
    populated when a GDAY message is received

- Doesn't say what multicast address. Doesn't say what port. 
   -> Specify at command line

- One thread waiting for GDAY/GBYE messages
- One thread sending GDAY messages periodically 

- One thread waiting for user input
   Scanner. Whenever \n is seen, handle timeouts/retransmissions/ACKS, then go
   back to scanner loop
- One thread waiting for SAY messages from other users
   -> simplest of all. Receive, send ACK, parse, -> stdout
